IoT door sensor-arduino-mqtt server (maybe use Solomon?) to show if anyone in the office.  The basic idea is to put a sensor in the door so that if the door is open people know someone is there.  make it able to be checked with an app/on our home page.

Need: 

* [ ] sensor
* [ ] arduino board
* [ ] wireless connection kit for board
* [x] mqtt server (uncheck if using solomon!)
* [ ] ios/android apps (maybe skip)
* [ ] web page insert code to show status of it.

My initial web research is [here](http://www.one-tab.com/page/xZWQ4pBBR6SXVgahuKJvZA).
